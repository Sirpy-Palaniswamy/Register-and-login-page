# Its very important that you change the names of the files inside the code if you are changing the file names to your use
## I used the names as stated below:
## Folder name of the project was registerlogin and the python file name was app.py
## layout.html
## home.html
## register.html
## login.html 
## message.html
## photo.html
People need to install these if not installed in their computers:
  pip install flask
  pip install flask-sqlalchemy
  pip install passlib
  anaconda

After this please create a new folder with project name on it anywhere you would like to, then open the anaconda prompt and make your way to that directory.

First create the "template" folder inside the project folder manually, then using any text editor or manually create a python file with any name on it. (This will be the main python file that we will be running each time).

Second create a "includes" folder inside the template folder.

Then we put these files in the folder accordingly:
     layout.html - template folder
     
     home.html - template folder
     
     register.html - template folder
     
     login.html - template folder
     
     message.html(Please put an underscore in front of the message word) - includes folder
     
     photo.html - template folder
     
     app.py - <projectname> folder

After finishing everything run the python file after directing yourself to the directory where the python file was created.
